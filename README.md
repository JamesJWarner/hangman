# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

The milestone python files are steps in creating the game.

milestone_2: basic setup of random word from list and a letter guess.

milestone_3: more advanced version of milestone 2 with functions.

milestone_4: Created a Hangman class with added functionality of updating the word-guessed variable and also displaying number of lives. 

milestone_5: Defined a function called play-game which would use the class created in milestone-4.
It also has the added functionality of telling the user if they win or lose
